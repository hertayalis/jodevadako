One time while I was on the road with a friend of mine and we were winding down after a long day of work and having some drinks, we got into a discussion on Uncle Fester from <a href=#>The Addams Family</a>, cracking up at the fact that he's immortal: dude's survived tons of attempted murders in Values and he came out unscathed from everyone.</p><p>We didn't text this conversation. We didn't search up Uncle Fester scenes on our phones, we simply spoke about Fester and cracked up laughing, had a few more beers, and then went to bed.</p><p>The next day when I woke up and was scrolling through my Instagram feed, guess what I saw an ad for? Fester's Quest t-shirts.</p><p>We're living in a <a href=#>day and age</a> where data-tracking and gathering is big, big business. Heck, the world's most popular social media application, TikTok, must comply with data sharing policies enforced by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Chinese Government</a> and is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">actively accessing personal user data of US Citizens from overseas servers</a>.</p><p>While tracking people's information through smartphones seems doable, how did Enfamil get a box of formula out to a woman who purchased a pregnancy test?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Dear <a href=#>@Walgreens</a> I received this package today a week after purchasing a pregnancy test at your store. I was asked to take the test by my doctor despite having no Fallopian tubes. 1/X <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/EZTsTPf7jd</a></p>— Nicole (@melancholynsex) <a href=#>July 17, 2022</a></figure><p>That's what happened to a Twitter user by the name of Nicole who posts under the handle @melancholynsex who visited a Walgreens location to purchase a pregnancy test.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I, of course, used my rewards card when checking out. So, I’m pretty sure that’s how this got to me. Let’s consider some things: 2/X</p>— Nicole (@melancholynsex) <a href=#>July 17, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter | @melancholynsex</span></figure><p>She says that about a week after purchasing the test, she received a box in the mail and in it were a few tubs of Enfamil baby formula along with a bottle for newborns, which was pretty perplexing to say the least: she didn't sign up for any promotions or give out her personal details to an Enfamil representative or an employee at the specific Walgreens location.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>THERE IS A FORMULA SHORTAGE, and yet <a href=#>@Enfamil</a> is sending out formula all willy-nilly based on the data you clearly sold them. Shame on you <a href=#>@Enfamil</a> 3/X</p>— Nicole (@melancholynsex) <a href=#>July 17, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter | @melancholynsex</span></figure><p>What she did do, however, was swipe her Walgreens card which probably contained her personal details and information on it. This info was probably culled from the location and then handed off to Enfamil, who then saw that they might have a prospective mama on their hands and want their formula to be the first one she sees.</p><p>Despite the creepy logistics of how Enfamil was able to send formula to Nicole, the Twitter user pointed out a few problems with their approach. The first being that she doesn't have Fallopian tubes but was asked by her doctor to take the test regardless.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Second, what if I were desperately trying to get pregnant and can’t? Wouldn’t this be a kick to the face?! 4/X</p>— Nicole (@melancholynsex) <a href=#>July 17, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter | @melancholynsex</span></figure><p>She also pointed out just how messed up it was for Enfamil to be sending out formula to people in the off chance that they might become moms and potentially new customers when they were in the midst of a formula shortage and mothers who needed to provide food for their actual living babies could actually benefit from the free tubs they're giving away.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Try this one on: I’m in an abusive relationship and my partner intercepts this package. Well, now what?! <a href=#>@Enfamil</a> 5/X</p>— Nicole (@melancholynsex) <a href=#>July 17, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter | @melancholynsex</span></figure><p>She also highlighted how insensitive the box might be to women who are trying to get pregnant but can't and even referenced the recent <a href=#>Roe v Wade overturning</a> as a potential incentive for Enfamil to start ramping up formula production.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>What do you say to the women in states where abortion is now illegal? Are you trying to make a political statement or is this just a big money grab? 6/X <a href=#>@Walgreens</a> <a href=#>@Enfamil</a></p>— Nicole (@melancholynsex) <a href=#>July 17, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter | @melancholysexn</span></figure><p>She also mentioned the dire consequences of a teen girl or someone in an abusive relationship who is sent this package, in their name. What becomes of them if their parents or partner gets violent, thinking that they've gotten pregnant on the DL?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>And here’s what the box says. REGIFTABLE?! Kiss off <a href=#>@Enfamil</a> and <a href=#>@Walgreens</a> from all the women who actually need this box that you are not helping. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/QYJndpgC6B</a></p>— Nicole (@melancholynsex) <a href=#>July 17, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter | @melancholysexn</span></figure><p>Nicole said that she ultimately reached out to her neighborhood community and found someone who could benefit from the formula, but thought that Enfamil sending out the gift was wrong on multiple levels.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>And just so everyone knows, I did post this in a local neighborhood group and gift it to a person in need.</p>— Nicole (@melancholynsex) <a href=#>July 17, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter | @melancholysexn</span></figure><p>What do you think? Are you creeped out at the fact that a company was able to gather someone's personal data, and then send them a bunch of baby formula based on the chance that they might be pregnant, without consideration for recent political developments regarding women's reproductive rights, or a national formula shortage that is affecting tons of different Mamas?</p><p>Or do you think this is just a case of someone reading into a company's "creative marketing strategies" too deeply?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mpJqhnJqxbq7Am7Bmnp%2Bnura4wA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./angela-bundalovic-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Angela Bundalovic Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr;
