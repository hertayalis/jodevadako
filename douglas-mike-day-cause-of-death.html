Shrapnel from a grenade also hit him. The initial phase of his healing lasted two years, but he revealed that he continued to experience suffering in his memoir “Perfectly Wounded,” set for release in 2020.</p><p>“I didn’t even know how terrible I was hurting until they came in and I saw the looks on their faces,” Day told Coffee or Die Magazine in 2020. This expression is well-known to everyone.</p><p>According to Day’s release paperwork acquired by Navy Times, he has been awarded the Silver Star “for exceptional courage and intrepidity in action,” as well as two Bronze Stars (one with combat valor), and a Purple Heart.</p><p>After the Medal of Honor and the Navy Cross, the Silver Star is the Navy and Marine Corps third-highest combat distinction for valor. The effects of military duty on Day’s mental health were documented in his memoir as well. They included PTSD and a traumatic brain injury.</p><p>He said it best to Coffee or Die: “Throughout my life, I’ve had a lot of trauma, and I have gained the perspective that I don’t care what happens.” “I’ll figure it out when it happens.”</p><p>In 1989, Day enlisted in the Navy, and he finally got out in 2010. After that, he became an official U.S. representative for wounded soldiers.
