I can't turn on the tap, I can't open the door, I can't go to the bathroom unless someone takes me and whenever I go out I have to be carried.</p><span class=quote-credit>Jyoti Amge</span><p>She was born with primordial dwarfish and while she is fiercely positive, she is also very limited by her height.</p><p>The rare genetic condition affects less than 100 people in the states and begins in the early gestational stages of a foetus.</p><p>She admitted that she can't go outside alone for fear that people might trample her, "I'm so small, people can't even see me," she said.</p><p>Her small size prevents her from doing most things on her own too, as things are too heavy for her.</p><p>"I can't go anywhere by my own choice. I can't turn on the tap, I can't open the door, I can't go to the bathroom unless someone takes me and whenever I go out I have to be carried," she said.</p><p>She is the youngest of five siblings, all of whom are normal height, and lives in India with her family.</p><p>Ranjana said she knew something was different with Jyoti during her pregnancy, she said: "She never moved in my womb like our other kids," and that when she went for a checkup she was so small that doctors couldn't see her on the sonogram.</p><p>If I find someone attractive I make him my close friend, nothing else because I am so short, our lives are too different.</p><span class=quote-credit>Jyoti</span><p>At just three pounds when she was born, medical staff believed she would only live a few hours.</p><p>But, against the odds, Jyoti developed like a regular baby until she was a toddler when it became apparent to the family that something wasn't quite right.</p><p>It was only during her time filming with TLC that she was officially diagnosed.</p><p>With a masters in fashion, she says that she tries to dress her age but that can often be tricky when the only clothes that fit her are for 3 month-old babies.</p><p>On the show, she describes herself as a "flirt", but admits that she's never actually kissed a man before.</p><p>"If I find someone attractive I make him my close friend, nothing else because I am so short, our lives are too different."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>She is incapable of having children due to her condition as she did not go through puberty.</p><p>Tragically for Jyoti, she also suffered a freak accident that left both legs broken, meaning that she is unable to walk longer than 10 minutes without being in agonising pain.</p><p>She was on a family holiday in Kashmir, India, when her dad slipped while carrying Jyoti - causing both her legs to be twisted in the process.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000594598974.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000594599500.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000594598975.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000594598976.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3ff2d0d3-f3d7-4992-855f-d86a1eeca003.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/a7184cde-107b-48da-9a91-0e079ae784b4-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zZ6urGdhZn50hZdsZrCnoqGxtHnSppilpJWowW7DzqaYp2Wgqr%2B0wcSsZJqbpJ67qHnCmqmenaJk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./alan-ospina-passes-away.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alan Ospina Passes Away, Bassment House Music DJ">&larr;
