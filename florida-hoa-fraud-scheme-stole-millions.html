That’s ridiculous.”</p><p>Baratz accused the HOA of abusing residents' money.</p><p>"This has really set me back. I didn’t want to lose my house, so what else could I do?" she said. "They were threatening to take it away if I don’t pay them.”</p><p>David Gersten, who began supervising the HOA after the scandal came to light found that the scheme actually generated $1million more than previously reported.</p><p>Gersten said in <a href=#>court</a> in February 2023 that the fraud turned out to be $3 million “and counting," <a aria-label="The Real Deal (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Real Deal</a> reported.</p><p>The court-ordered receiver explained that ex-board members used 55 bank accounts and credit cards, which Gersten called this “exceedingly abnormal” for an association.</p><p>Four other ex-HOA board members were also sued in April 2023 for allegedly playing a part in the scheme by “allowing or failing to stop the ongoing misappropriation of funds by former board members,”&nbsp;according to the civil complaint obtained by <a aria-label="The Real Deal (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Real Deal</a>.</p><p>Ligia Capielo, Merlene Kopec, Madeline Maceda, and Luz Ordonez were named in the lawsuit as the defendants.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Last April an election was held for seven new board members.</p><p>“It was a secure and fair election.
