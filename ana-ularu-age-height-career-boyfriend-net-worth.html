Ana Ularu is also one of those Romanian actresses who has done pretty good work and slowly climbing up the ranks.</p><p>Ularu is not only a good actress, but awards also tend to speak volumes of her class. Be it in Emerald City, Outbound, and many others, she has done right and even made a great dime. So today, we will enlighten you all with details.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ana-1256.jpg><p>But first, some quick facts tend to help the search</p><p>Ana Ularu: Quick Facts</p><table class=table><tbody><tr><th>Full Name</th><td>Ana Ularu</td></tr><tr><th>Date of Birth</th><td>1985/06 /26</td></tr><tr><th>Nickname</th><td>Ana</td></tr><tr><th>Marital Status</th><td>Single</td></tr><tr><th>Birthplace</th><td>Romania</td></tr><tr><th>Ethnicity</th><td>Mixed</td></tr><tr><th>Age</th><td>34</td></tr><tr><th>Profession</th><td>Actress</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality</th><td>Romanian</td></tr><tr><th>Height</th><td>5’5″</td></tr><tr><th>Eye color</th><td>Blue</td></tr><tr><th>Hair color</th><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><th>Net Worth</th><td>$2 million</td></tr><tr><th>Online Presence</th><td><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Ana Ularu Wiki-Bio</h2><p>Ana Ularu was born on June 26, 1985, in Romania. The name of her parents is <strong>Mihaela</strong> and <strong>Nicolae</strong>. There is hardly any information on her siblings, though. So we feel that she must have been a single child, but the growth has always been commendable of this artist.</p><p>Likewise, Ularu belongs to Romanian nationality and also holds a mixed ethnicity. The zodiac sign for her is Cancer.</p><h2>Age and Body Measurements</h2><p>Ana was born in 1985, which makes her 34 years old as of now. She stands at the height of 5’5″ and also weighs 50 kgs. The Romanian accent tends to support and make her look differently beautiful in front of a lot of other artists. But sadly, there is nothing about the vital body statistics of her.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emily Watson Chernobyl Actress Bio, Movies, Net Worth, Career, Relationship >></a></h4><p>The hourglass body shape is lucrative and tends to attract several fans to go along with her height and weight. The shining pair of blue eyes and also flawless brown hair tend to outlast the beauty for more extended periods.</p><h2>Early Life and Education</h2><p>Ana was born in Romania and spent most of her childhood there with her family and siblings. Some of the sources suggest that she is a single child. If it is the case, then well, she is highly pampered, and there was a pretty good bond in the family. The freedom to choose a career in acting is something that shows the liberal nature of the family.</p><p>For the educational background, though, there is hardly anything available. Almost all of it is kept under the radar. As she is a pretty good actress, we feel that Ana attended some acting school to garnish the skills for the future.</p><h2>Ana Ularu Career</h2><p>Ana Ularu is one of those artists who perform the work in the dark, and all of their success tends to make a big noise. Similarly, the handful of acting works has earned her a vast amount of fame and fortune.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Riverdale Actress&amp;#8217; Nathalie Boltt Age, Height, Husband, Kids, Net Worth >></a></h4><p>The debut came in the year 1995 when she was part of Passion Mortelle as <strong>Victoria</strong> and later played Claudia’s role in Meurtres par procuration in the same year. Works in movies and series were going hand in hand. Other recognizable works of this artist came in Damen Tango, Magnatul, Love Close-up, Afterimage, Inferno, Muse, and more recently, Siberia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ana-1257.jpg><p>Apart from work in movies, TV show prowess includes the likes of Cn Un Pas Inainte, Anacondas: Trail of Blood, Life on Top, The Borgias, etc.; how much might be the projects, but the commendable work came in the year 2010. It was the movie named Outbound that brought her six awards, which shows the fact that she is a pretty good actress.</p><p>For O Vara’s work, Foarte Instabila Ana was nominated as the best actress in the Leading role but didn’t win it. Surely there is more to come from this talented artist, and we will let you all know in detail.</p><h2>Boyfriend</h2><p>Ana Ularu is a rising star who has risen the ranks recently. Her success stairs are increasing with each passing year, but she has also done significant work to keep all of the information away from the media.</p><p>As of now, she is single. Surprisingly not only now, but Ana is never seen together with any man, be it on an event or award shows. Uluru might be keeping all away from the media and living a pretty crucial low love life, but there is hardly anything in it. Other than this, the pretty actress is close to <strong>Cristian Balint</strong>.</p><h2>Ana Ularu Net Worth</h2><p>Ana Ularu is equally active in both TV and movies and has earned fame, fortune together. As of 2019, the net worth of Ana Ularu is estimated to be <strong>$2 million</strong>. All of this is the result of dedication in the field of acting and might be endorsements too.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Venessa Villanueva Bio, Age, Actress, Husband, Instagram >></a></h4><p>Even though we have information on the net worth, there is absolutely nothing available about the annual income and also the assets owned. But we feel that something will pop out soon, and we will keep you all updated.</p><h2>Social Media Reach</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Instagram</a>– 20.6k followers</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Twitter</a>– 3543 followers</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57wKeYZq2clr%2B2ecCgnGaglZ60qcCMnJirnZWneqO72J%2Bpop2emXqvsdNmrqiqpJ18</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gabby-granado.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gabby Granado Wiki, Age (Gary Woodlands Wife) Biography, Kids &amp;amp; More">&larr;
