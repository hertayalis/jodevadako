Throughout the show, the McLusky family will have to deal with various hard-hitting issues preventing the city from progressing, including inequality, systematic racism, and corruption, to name a few.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>The critically-acclaimed series, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">stars Jeremy Renner</a>, Emma Laird, Nichole Galicia, Hugh Dillon, Kyle Chandler, Taylor Handley, Dianne Wiest, Aidan Gillen, Hamish Allan-Headley, and many others. The series made headlines following the premiere of two consecutive episodes, including “In Left with the Nose” and “Drones,” which both took place <a href=#>during season two</a>.</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=733 data-injectable=true>In the episode, “Left with the Nose,” police Sergeant Robert Sawyer (Headley) revealed that he was given a “heart attack letter,” with which the district attorney advised him to lawyer up. This all took place while in a crisis meeting with Mike (Renner), Detective Kyle McLusky (Handley), and Detective Ian Ferguson (Dillon).</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=191 data-injectable=false>This article will address what a “heart attack letter” is, why Robert and his SWAT team received it, how this could jeopardize his team’s future, and how Mike saved the day.</p><p data-characters=15 data-current-count=206 data-injectable=false><strong>Spoilers ahead!</strong></p><h2 id=h-the-heart-attack-letter-explained data-injectable=false>The heart attack letter, explained</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/mayor-of-kingstown-mike.png><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fiction Horizon</a>, a “heart attack letter” is a document sent out to an individual or a team when Kingston PD internal affairs plan to investigate them. In this case, Robert received the letter because the government looked into the numerous inmates’ deaths when a prison riot ensued.</p><p data-characters=135 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>This riot was incited while detectives Ferguson and (Ian) McLusky tried transferring a criminal, Milo Sunter, to the DA’s office.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Why are Robert Sawyer and his SWAT team involved in the heart attack letter?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/mayor-of-kingstown.png><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true>In the early stages of the prison riot, Ian and Kyle were knocked unconscious by the individuals who instigated the rampage. After waking up, the detectives found themselves trapped in the middle of a riot and attempted to hide in the prison’s vent. While in the vent, Kyle informed Sgt. Sawyer about their location and the event that had transpired.</p><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>Sawyer and his SWAT team immediately rushed to rescue Ian and Kyle, but it came at a price. To get the men, Sawyer and his team had to make the tough decision to shoot and kill inmates, and because this incident occurred outside the force’s jurisdiction, it caused a lot of conflict up the chain of command.</p><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=753 data-injectable=true>During the episode, Sawyer assumed he received the heart attack letter because an inmate shared information about what happened with the district attorney. But it was later revealed that one of Robert’s men was actually behind this. What makes matters even worse is that this individual and the SWAT team have also participated in other illegal shootings against criminals to prevent them from using the justice system in their favor.</p><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false>Robert ultimately discovers the identity of the person who betrayed him in the next episode, “Drones.” The individual was known as “Ben”. The episode revealed that Ben negotiated a deal with the district attorney to testify against his colleagues. This revelation would upset others, including Ian and Kyle because they claimed that Ben shot about 20 inmates at least.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How does Mike help Robert and his SWAT team?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/mayor-of-kingstown-paramount.png><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=165 data-injectable=false>As things came to a head, Mike advised Robert to make sure that everyone’s story regarding the situation was similar so that they combat Ben’s testimony.</p><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=619 data-injectable=true>In addition to suggesting the indistinguishable story, Mike also shared with Robert and the team that they should refrain from communicating with Ben due to his alliance with the district attorney. Mike brings up that he is the only person who can directly speak to Ben because he isn’t connected to the investigation. With his ties to the assistant district attorney, Mike can also get details regarding the case that can help Robert and the team.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>However, Ben is soon let’s say… “Out of the picture”, and things regarding the letter and the ensuing court case are in some serious jeopardy. In the meantime, Mike is indeed evermore focused on the Aryan Brotherhood, the town’s true menaces as the second season draws to a close.</p><p data-characters=77 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>All episodes of <a href=#>Mayor of Kingstown</a> are currently streaming on Paramount Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKKrXZZ6qbHAq6tmmaSprqS3jKWcrayVp3qquoymmLKnomK8p3nKoqWgq6SkxK97</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./why-does-dolly-parton-wear-long-sleeves.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Does Dolly Parton Always Wear Long Sleeves?
